// Create a function that accepts an unsigned 8-bit integer and returns its binary reverse,
// padded so that it holds precisely eight binary digits.
// Tip: When you get the binary representation of a number, Swift will always use as few bits as possible
// â€“ make sure you pad to eight binary digits before reversing.

    let reversedBinary = String(paddedBinary.reversed())
